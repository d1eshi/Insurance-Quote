# Insurance Quote

Hi, this is a project realized in course [JavaScript Moderno Gu√≠a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). In this project the objective is to create an **auto insurance quote** for the user.

## Technologies

I have used basic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. Most of the styles are made in **Bootstrap**.

### Javascript

In JavaScript we use as main concept the **Prototypes**, to create a _basic constructor_. As well as _instantiating the use of the UI_, then a validation of the simple fields is performed (_here the UI is used to give a user experience_). As another operation to highlight are the **operations** that are carried out to perform the insurance calculation depending on _the year, brand and type of insurance._
